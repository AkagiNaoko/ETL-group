# Crowdfunding Data ETL Project

## Team: Ji, Ran	Gorvie, Alfred 

This repository hosts the codebase for the Crowdfunding Data ETL project. This project is designed to extract, transform, and load crowdfunding data into a structured database format using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL.  

## About The Project 
The Crowdfunding Data ETL project is a comprehensive pipeline that takes raw data from multiple sources, transforms it into a usable format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The aim of the project is to convert disorganized data into a structured format, making it easier for end-users to analyze and glean insights. 

The primary steps involved in this project are:  

Extracting data from the source files  
Transforming and cleaning the data  
Creating four CSV files: Category, Subcategory, Campaign, Contacts  
Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema  
Loading the CSV data into a PostgreSQL database
